from this first analysis, it is clear that the use of different memory spaces does not affect the performance
of the code so we shouldn't push in this direction. For semplicity we will then use Memory Management for 
the rest of the project.

This is justified by the fact that the communication between CPU and GPU is not significant, since we are 
moving only two floats.
